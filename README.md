TLBF
========

Tiny Little BrainF*** library and interpreter.

This is not the smallest BF interpreter ever written. 
It's not the most complete BF interpreter ever written.

The reason for tlbf's existence is that I set myself a task to write a
[bf compiler for Intel 8080](https://github.com/nistur/8080bf) however
I then decided that I wanted to be able to test any bf I was writing a
bit easier, so I set about shaving my very own yak and writing an
interpreter. 

The idea behind tlbf is that is supports bf syntax, but also should be
easy to provide support for other substitution syntax, such as
Ook. Also planned are extensions which provide things such as
procedures as defined by pbrain and such.

>The 'Tiny Little' creed:
>* Keep the interface small
>* Keep the dependencies minimal
>* Keep the implementation (relatively) clean and portable
